WHAT IS WEB APP MANIFEST:

-The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that informs the browser about your web app. It tells how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. And to show the Add to Home Screen prompt, the web app manifest is required.

What is a Service Worker?

- Notice that PWAs run only on https because the service worker can access the request and handle it. Therefore security is required.

- A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background in a separate thread. That means it runs in a different place and is completely separate from your web page. That's the reason why it can't manipulate your DOM element.

- However, it's super powerful. The service worker can intercept and handle network requests, manage the cache to enable offline support or send push notifications to your users.
